<p>I hope to use the skills I've accumulated both new and old to continuously evolve into my purpose. After identifying and honing in on those skills I hope to impact my community in a positive manner. I hope that through my story young men and women in inner cities will feel empowered to chase their dreams, by helping to build both wealth and a sense of family within their communites.</p>
    <p>I have a strong passion for empowering others not only to feel beautiful,but to discover their purpose and utilize the gifts and talents GOD bestowed upon them. I have a strong passion for beauty, specifically hair and makeup. So in my spare time outside of working or doing community work I do makeup and hair for others.About four years ago I started a business/service called TouchedbyTahj where I provide service to other individuals. My goal is just to continue practicing, building and branding until I can launch an official site with varoius products. </p>
